# Arithmetic-formatter
Here is a little program that arranges arithmetic problems vertically to make them easier to solve. it is very intuitive and asks also to solve the equations. 
For example, "127 - 3452" becomes:

```
   127
+ 3452
------
```

I did this for fun, while learning the module Scinetific computing with python on Freecodecamp.org.
